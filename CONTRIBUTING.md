# Contributing to the Hungarian Etymological CLDF Dataset

Thank you for considering contributing to loanpy! This software was developed for the PhD project "Gothic loanwords in Hungarian" at the University of Vienna. Built on the CLDF standards, loanpy has no dependencies and can be used to train, evaluate, and apply predictive models for horizontal (borrowing) or vertical (historical) lexical transfers. It also allows for searching (old) loanwords between two unrelated languages, providing insights into the (ancient) history of languages and the people who spoke them.
