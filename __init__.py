loanpy is a toolkit for solving various linguistic tasks such as:

    - predicting loanword adaptation (lateral transfers)
    - historical reconstruction of words (vertical transfers)
    - searching for potential (old) loanwords between two languages.

For an installation guide, click on the Cheese Shop logo. To see the latest \
but perhaps not the most stable version, click on Octocat. \
