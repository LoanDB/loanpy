loanpy is a toolkit for solving various linguistic tasks such as:

    - predicting loanword adaptation (lateral transfers)
    - historical reconstruction of words (vertical transfers)
    - searching for potential (old) loanwords between two languages.

For an installation guide, click on the Cheese Shop logo. To see the newest \
but maybe less stable version, click on Octocat. For citation visit Zenodo:
