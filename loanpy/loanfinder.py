"""
This module is designed to identify and analyze potential loanwords between a
donor and a recipient language. It processes two input dataframes, one
representing the donor language with adapted forms and the other representing
the recipient language with reconstructed forms. The module first identifies
phonetic matches between the two languages and then calculates their semantic
similarity. The output is a list of candidate loanwords, which can be further
analyzed for linguistic or historical purposes.

The primary functions in this module are responsible for finding phonetic
matches between the given donor and recipient language data and calculating
their semantic similarity. These functions process the input dataframes and
compare the phonetic patterns, as well as calculate the semantic similarity
based on a user-provided function. The module returns a list of candidate
loanwords ranked by their phonetic and semantic similarities. The output can
then be used to study linguistic borrowing, adaptation, and reconstruction
processes between the donor and recipient languages.
