This tutorial will walk you through the process of using loanpy to
discover old loanwords.

Here is an illustration of the full workflow with a minimal example:

   The overall workflow with a minimal example

Step 1: Mine sound correspondences
----------------------------------

Grab an etymological dictionary and extract information of how sounds
and phonotactic patterns changed during horizontal and vertical transfers.
Find a detailed guide in `Part 3 (steps 1-4) of ronataswestoldturkic's
documentation
<https://ronataswestoldturkic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mkloanpy.html>`_.
In the minimal example, our dictionary contains only one etymology, namely
a horizontal transfer "*gigi ‚Üê gege" and a vertical transfer "kiki < *gigi".
If we mine the sound correspondences we'd get the rule "g from g, i from e"
in horizontal transfers and "k from g, i from i" in vertical transfers.
In terms of phonotactics, we can mine "CVCV from CVCV" both horizontally
and vertically.

Step 2: Apply sound correspondences
-----------------------------------

Use the information extracted from the etymological data
in combination with heuristics to hypothesise on how Hungarian
words may have sounded in the past and how Gothic words may have been
adapted.

For detailed guides see the documentation of the `gerstnerhungarian
<https://gerstnerhungarian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_ and
`koeblergothic <https://koeblergothic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_
repositories

Step 3: Find old loanwords
--------------------------

To find old loanwords by searching for phonetic and semantic overlaps
within the hypothesised data follow the `documentation of the
GothicHungarian repository
<https://gothichungarian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_
