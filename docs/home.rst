LoanPy: Detect Ancient Borrowings Computationally
-------------------------------------------------

LoanPy is a linguistic toolkit developed during a PhD at the University
of Vienna (2018-2023) to identify ancient loanwords between two languages.
It offers the following features:

    - Extraction of sound and phonotactic correspondences from etymological data
    - Predictions on loanword adaptation and historical reconstruction
    - Evaluation of the quality of the predictive models
    - Searching for phonetic and semantic matches between two lists of
      form-meaning pairs

Access LoanPy through the following platforms:
