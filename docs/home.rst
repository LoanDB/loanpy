LoanPy is a linguistic toolkit to detect ancient borrowings computationally.
It was part of my dissertation-project at the `Finno-Ugric department
of the University of Vienna <https://finno-ugristik.univie.ac.at/>`_,
which aimed to answer the question whether there are any Gothic loanwords
in Hungarian. The project was partly funded by the
`University of Helsinki <https://www.helsinki.fi/en>`_
and the `Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
<https://www.eva.mpg.de/index/>`_ in Leipzig.

The software offers following features:

    - Extraction of sound and phonotactic correspondences from etymological data
    - Predictions on loanword adaptation and historical reconstruction
    - Evaluation of the quality of the predictive models
    - Searching for phonetic and semantic matches between two lists of
      form-meaning pairs

Access LoanPy through the following platforms:

Data Formats (CLDF) initiative <https://cldf.clld.org>`_.
