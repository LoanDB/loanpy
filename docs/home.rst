   :alt: The LoanPy logo: "loanpy" in simple white cursive italics on black
         background. On the right side as part of the logo are two
         translucent gray-ish shapes that look like laying 8s. One is
         smaller and darker and appears to be in the back, the other is
         larger, brighter, and appears to be in the front.
         Their circles are overlapping, so that the smaller top circle of the
         8 in the front is covering the larger part of the bottom circle of
         the smaller 8 in the back. And vice versa the top circle of the
         smaller 8 in the back is overlapping with a small part of the bottom
         circle of the large 8 in the front. The image vaguely resembles
         two venn-diagrams, or two very round bowling pins that fell: one
         to the left, one to right.

Intro
-----

LoanPy is a linguistic toolkit to detect ancient borrowings computationally.
It was part of my dissertation-project at the `Finno-Ugric department
of the University of Vienna <https://finno-ugristik.univie.ac.at/en/>`_,
which aimed to answer the question whether there are any Gothic loanwords
in Hungarian. The project was partly funded by the
`University of Helsinki <https://www.helsinki.fi/en>`_
and the `Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
<https://www.eva.mpg.de/index/>`_ in Leipzig.

The software offers following features:

- Extraction of sound and phonotactic correspondences from etymological data
- Predictions on loanword adaptation and historical reconstruction
- Evaluation of the quality of the predictive models
- Searching for phonetic and semantic matches between two lists of
  form-meaning pairs

LoanPy adheres to the standards set forth by the `Cross-Linguistic
Data Formats (CLDF) <https://cldf.clld.org>`_ initiative.
