LoanPy is a linguistic toolkit to detect ancient borrowings computationally.
It was developed during a PhD at the University of Vienna (2018-2023) and
offers the following features:

    - Extraction of sound and phonotactic correspondences from etymological data
    - Predictions on loanword adaptation and historical reconstruction
    - Evaluation of the quality of the predictive models
    - Searching for phonetic and semantic matches between two lists of
      form-meaning pairs
