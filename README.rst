LoanPy: A Comprehensive Linguistic Toolkit
==========================================

LoanPy is a powerful linguistic toolkit developed during the course of my PhD thesis, providing solutions for various linguistic tasks, such as:

- Predicting loanword adaptation (lateral transfers)
- Historical reconstruction of words (vertical transfers)
- Searching for potential (old) loanwords between two languages

This versatile toolkit has been designed with ease of use and compatibility in mind, offering a standalone, easy-to-setup, and cross-platform solution that works with Python 3.7 or higher.
