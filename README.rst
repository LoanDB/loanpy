Intro
-----

LoanPy is a linguistic toolkit developed during the course of my PhD thesis
at the University of Vienna, providing solutions for various tasks in
historical and contact linguistics, such as:

- Mining correspondence patterns from etymological data on the level of
  phonology and phonotactics
- Predicting loanword adaptation (lateral/horizontal transfers) based on
  heuristics and etymological data
- Historical reconstruction of words (vertical transfers) based on
  etymological data
- Evaluating the quality of the predictive models
- Searching for potential (old) loanwords between two languages

This toolkit has been designed with ease of use and compatibility in mind,
offering a standalone, easy-to-setup, and cross-platform solution that works
with Python 3.7 or higher.
