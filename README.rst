loanpy: A Comprehensive Linguistic Toolkit
==========================================

loanpy is a powerful linguistic toolkit developed during the course of my PhD thesis, providing solutions for various linguistic tasks, such as:

- extracting correspondence patterns from etymological data on the level of phonology and phonotactics
- Predicting loanword adaptation (lateral/horizontal transfers) based on heuristics and etymological data
- Historical reconstruction of words (vertical transfers) based on etymological data
- Searching for potential (old) loanwords between two languages

This versatile toolkit has been designed with ease of use and compatibility in mind, offering a standalone, easy-to-setup, and cross-platform solution that works with Python 3.7 or higher.
