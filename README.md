Partial and preliminary results of my ongoing PhD Project "Gothic-Hungarian relations" at University of Vienna  
  
What is what?  
  
-"computer-aided borrowing detection framework.pptx": an outline.  
-"AllChanges.xlsx": which Hungarian words are from Uralic, Finno-Ugric and Ugric (from http://www.uralonet.nytud.hu/) and how their sounds changed  
-"Quantify_SoundChanges": which sound changes appeared how often and in which words  
-"NSE.xlsx": Hungarian etymologies ranked according to their credibility  
-"Protoforms.xlsx": generated hypothetical Uralic protoforms of Hungarian words of unknown origin appearing in texts before 1600 (Etimológiai szótár, Zaicz Gábor, 2006)   
-"noderivIN.xlsx": Same as Protoform.xlsx but input is automatically stripped from potential derivational suffixes  
-"Substitutions.csv": Potential sound subsitution of Gothic phonemes into Proto-Uralic  
-"Match.xlsx": Identical words between hypothetical Proto-Uralic words and substituted Gothic words (https://koeblergerhard.de/wikiling/?f=got), both of structure CVCV 
  
Transcriptions are based on IPA (https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/) and Uralisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch (UEW) (cf. http://uralonet.nytud.hu/help.cgi?locale=hu_HU)  
  
Own symbols:  
¨ - any front vowel  
∅ - any vowel that disappeared in Hungarian or was not there in the Proto-language  
0 - any consonant that disappeared in Hungarian or was not there in the Proto-language
