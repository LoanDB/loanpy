If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by opening an issue or contacting me. I take security issues seriously and will respond within a day.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much information as possible, such as:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, if possible
- Any potential impact on users or the system
- Suggestions for mitigating or resolving the issue, if any

## Vulnerability Handling Process

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, I will take the following steps:

1. Acknowledge receipt of the report and provide an estimated time for our initial response.
2. Investigate the reported vulnerability and determine its impact on the project.
3. Develop and test a fix for the vulnerability.
4. Release a security update and notify users of the availability of the update.
5. Publicly disclose the vulnerability, crediting the reporter if desired, after the fix has been released and users have had a reasonable amount of time to update.

Thank you for helping us ensure the security of this project.
